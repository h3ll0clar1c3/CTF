4. Weak Encryption Challenge

Description: 

Break a weak XOR cipher to reveal the flag.

Implementation Steps:

1. Create a Python script to encrypt the flag with XOR.
2. Provide the encrypted flag and key.

Additional Setup Required:

Encrypted Flag Output:
* The script generates an "encrypted flag" as output. You should provide participants with the encrypted flag as the challenge input.
Encryption Key:
* You can include the encryption key in a separate file or as part of the challenge description (if you want to make the challenge solvable).

Additional Info:

The encrypted flag will be a simple text file. Below is an example file for participants.

Encrypted flag: ¬ÖÔÜÆÓÔ×ÖÜÔ×ÉÊ

Steps to Set Up:

1. Use the provided encryption script (weak_encryption.py) to generate the encrypted flag.
2. Save the output in encrypted_flag.txt.
3. Share the file with participants, along with the challenge description.
