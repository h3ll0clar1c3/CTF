2. XSS Challenge

Description: 

Participants must execute a reflected XSS payload to reveal the flag.

Implementation Steps:

1. Create an HTML page with a vulnerable search form.
2. Display user input without sanitization.

Additional Setup Required:

* No additional setup is required. The code (HTML file) is standalone and only requires hosting on a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or Python's http.server module).

Additional Info:

The XSS challenge is a static HTML file, so no additional setup is required. You can host it using Python's http.server module.

 'python -m http.server 8080'

This will serve the directory containing xss_challenge.html on http://localhost:8080.
