7. Packet Analysis Challenge

Description: 

Analyze a PCAP file to retrieve the flag.

Implementation Steps:

1. Use scapy to generate a PCAP file with HTTP data.
2. Embed the flag in the HTTP payload.

Additional Info:

Generate the PCAP file using the script provided earlier. Below is a README file for participants.

# Packet Analysis Challenge

## Description
Analyze the provided PCAP file (`challenge.pcap`) to retrieve the hidden flag. Use tools like Wireshark to inspect the network traffic.

## Hints
- Look for HTTP traffic in the capture.
- The flag is embedded within the payload of one of the packets.

## Tools
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net) (optional)

Steps to Set Up:

1. Run the PCAP generation script (generate_pcap.py) to produce challenge.pcap.
2. Share the PCAP file and README.md with participants.
