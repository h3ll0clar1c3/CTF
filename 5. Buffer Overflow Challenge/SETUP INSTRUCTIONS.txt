5. Buffer Overflow Challenge

Description: 

Exploit a buffer overflow in a C program to reveal the flag.

Implementation Steps:

1. Write a vulnerable C application.
2. Compile the program with debugging symbols.

Additional Setup Required:

Compiled Binary (buffer_overflow):
* Compile the C program using gcc with debug symbols enabled (e.g., gcc -o buffer_overflow buffer_overflow.c -g).
* Provide the compiled binary to participants alongside the source code if necessary.


Additional Info:

Participants need a compiled binary and source code to test the buffer overflow. Below is a Makefile to compile the C program.

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-g -fno-stack-protector -z execstack

all: buffer_overflow

buffer_overflow: buffer_overflow.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o buffer_overflow buffer_overflow.c
	
Implementation steps:

1. Save the C program (buffer_overflow.c) and the Makefile in the same directory.
2. Compile the program using:
 'make'
3. Share the compiled binary (buffer_overflow) with participants.
