3. Steganography Challenge

Description: 

Embed a flag into an image using steganography.

Implementation Steps:

1. Use the pillow Python library to encode hidden text into an image.
2. Save the image as the challenge file.

Additional Setup Required:

Input Image (input.jpg):
* You need an input image file to encode the hidden flag. This can be any image (e.g., a .jpg or .png file).
Output Image (encoded.png):
* This will be generated by the provided Python script. Participants will need to analyze this file to extract the hidden flag.

Additional Info:

For this challenge, you need an input image (input.jpg) to encode the hidden flag. Below is an example command-line script to decode the hidden flag from the output image.

from PIL import Image

def decode_image(encoded_image_path):
    encoded = Image.open(encoded_image_path)
    width, height = encoded.size
    hidden_message = ""

Steps to Set Up:

1. Use the encoding script (stegano.py) provided earlier to generate encoded.png.
2. Provide encoded.png to participants.
3. Share the decoding script (decode_stegano.py) or let them solve it independently.
